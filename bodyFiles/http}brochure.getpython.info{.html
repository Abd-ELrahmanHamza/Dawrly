The Python Software Foundation (PSF) has collected success stories and case studies over the last two years and we've created a beautiful, professional quality printed brochure to promote the usage of Python to audiences which we are currently not reaching well. We cover business, science, industry, education, media, government, public sector and charity stories. Our target groups are CIOs and chief developers, scientists and programmers, university lecturers, teachers and students, customers, clients, managers and employees. We are out of stock after 10,000 printed copies distributed worldwide in the last years. Until a new edition is planned, you can still get the PDF file as download.
